Vanderbilt VICTR (KL2) - $450,000

Examining the psychophysical and neurophysiological response to pain stimuli in communicative patients with Alzheimer's disease. Using fMRI analysis, we are able to determine regions of activation that correspond to the thermal pain we apply to participants while they undergo a 3T fMRI. The fMRI procedure is coupled with psychophysics and various questionnaires to determine affect, potential for depression, and overall pain experienced by the participant
