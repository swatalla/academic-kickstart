# Biography

I am a research coordinator at The Ohio State University College of Nursing's Pain and Aging Lab. My research is focused on alterations in pain processing in older adults with Alzheimer's disease. Our methods incorporate psychophysics collection and MRI acquisition. With my background in physics and chemistry, I possess a technical knowledge of multiple imaging modalities, as well as a strong competency in mathematics and statistics.
